## Getting Started

This project uses **Python Flask** for backend framework, **React** for frontend, and **mySQL** for database.
___
### Populating the Database
 1. Locate `NBA_db.sql` in the main folder.
 2. Use MySQL Workbench or a similar tool to import and populate the database.
 3. fter populating the database, configure the database connection parameters in `nba-stats-server/app.py`:
    - **host**: Your local host address (usually 'localhost')
    - **username**: Your MySQL username
    - **password**: Your MySQL password
    - **database**: The name of your populated database
___
### Deploying the Backend


1. Navigate to the `nba-stats-server` directory and Install the required Python dependencies:

  ```sh
  cd nba-stats-server
  pip install -r requirement.txt
  ```

2. Start the backend server:
```sh
python app.py
```
___
### Setting Up the Frontend

1. In the `nba-stats-frontend/src/const.js` file, update the `base_url` to your backend address (if running locally, this will be `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in most cases).
2. Move to the `nba-stats-frontend` directory and install the necessary Node.js dependencies:

```sh
  cd nba-stats-frontend
  npm install
```
3. Start the frontend application:
```sh
npm start
```
4. Access the frontend in a web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
